### Currently Building

**Task Manager App** :
- PostgreSQL: Tables for User, Project, Task, and Tag with proper relations, indexes, and migrations
- EF Core + Fluent API: Entity models with constraints, cascade rules, and validation logic
- ASP.NET Core API: RESTful CRUD controllers following SOLID principles and dependency injection
- JWT Authentication: Secure signup/login with role-based access control
- Task Features: Deadlines, priorities, statuses, and tag filtering
- Microservices (planned): Notifications, Analytics, and Auth separation via REST or RabbitMQ
- Frontend (later): Blazor or React with responsive UI and drag-and-drop task board

### Why I Build & Share

I create open-source repositories not just to solve problems, but to build reusable knowledge systems.  
My goal is to help others learn faster, think deeper, and write cleaner code — whether they're preparing for interviews, building backend systems, or exploring rare algorithms.

I believe in architectural clarity, modular documentation, and sharing patterns that others can build on.  
Every repo I publish is part of a long-term vision: to grow as a backend engineer, contribute to the developer community, and make technical knowledge more accessible.

I'm still learning — and I share as I go.

### Contact & Collaboration

If you're building systems, solving hard problems, or exploring algorithmic architecture — let's connect.  
I'm open to freelance work, backend roles, and open-source collaboration.

Reach out via GitHub or any of the platforms above.
