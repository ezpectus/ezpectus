### Why I Build & Share

I create open-source repositories not just to solve problems, but to build reusable knowledge systems.  
My goal is to help others learn faster, think deeper, and write cleaner code — whether they're preparing for interviews, building backend systems, or exploring rare algorithms.

I believe in architectural clarity, modular documentation, and sharing patterns that others can build on.  
Every repo I publish is part of a long-term vision: to grow as a backend engineer, contribute to the developer community, and make technical knowledge more accessible.

I'm still learning — and I share as I go.
