# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Denys (@ezpectus)

ðŸ”§ Junior .NET Developer focused on clean architecture, scalable backend systems, and solving real-world problems through code.

ðŸš€ Currently building:
- A SaaS Finance Manager Platform (.NET Core, REST API, SQL, DI, SOLID)
- A 2D action-platformer (Unity, C#) with procedural level generation, JSON-based save/load, and modular gameplay systems

ðŸ§  Learning:
- Advanced backend patterns (.NET 9, Microservices, PostgreSQL)
- Frontend with React & TypeScript (for full-stack flexibility)
- Algorithmic thinking (solved 350+ LeetCode problems)

ðŸŽ¯ What I value:
- Writing clean, maintainable code
- Learning fast and teaching others (check out my open-source template!)
- Building systems that actually help people

ðŸ“ˆ Open for: freelance work, backend-focused junior roles, and open-source collaboration
